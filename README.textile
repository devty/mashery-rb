A Ruby library for the "Mashery API":http://support.mashery.com/docs/mashery_api.

h2. Prerequisites

Install the gem dependencies (see "gembundler.com":http://gembundler.com/ if you aren't familiar with Bundler):

@$ bundle install@

h2. Calling methods from the command line

A set of Thor tasks are provided so that you can call API methods from the command line (read more about Thor at
"http://github.com/wycats/thor":http://github.com/wycats/thor).

The following examples assume you have Thor installed system-wide. If it's local to your bundle, then replace
@thor@ with @bundle exec thor@.

You can see all available Mashery tasks with this command:

@$ thor list mashery@

h3. Environment

Before you can successfully call an API method, you must set these environment variables:

bc. $ export MASHERY_SITE_ID=666
$ export MASHERY_API_KEY=cafebebedeadbeefcafebebedeadbeef
$ export MASHERY_SHARED_SECRET=blahblahblah
